I've come to realise that some of the people that have had the most impact on my life - I've never met before. Reading Paul Graham's essays got me into the world of tech and startups. Reading Pieter Level's blog posts got me excited about the idea of working remotely and being able to travel and explore the world, while still working hard and progressing in your career. It's a big part of the reason I have a remote job now. 

Even if I'm not able to reach the dizzying heights that these two aforementioned people have reached, I hope that this blog can be a useful resource for people who are going down the same path as I am. I plan to post as I build things, work remotely and try to find my way in the world of startups.
