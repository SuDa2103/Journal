#### TL;DR
* I did a ton of research and ended up investing in a project called Dronies
* I liked the designs, the team behind the project, the roadmap and the hype they managed to generate around their launch. 
* There were problems at the start which meant I couldn't mint one, so I had to buy one on the secondary market at a slightly higher price. 


#### How I found out
I was watching a Noah kagan video where he interviews NFT experts, and one of them mentioned a project called Dronies. That peaked my interest because there are a dozen NFT projects launching every day, so I wanted to find out more about why he was so excited about this one in particular. 


#### Why I Took the Plunge
At its core, the product I wanted to build was a forum. So I found a reddit clone tutorial on YouTube and followed it step by step. This turned out to be very useful because the tutorial included bits of code that I would have never been able to add myself. For example, this snippet of code deals with ranking posts on the homepage. While I’m sure I would’ve got around to this, I’m not sure I would have had this kind of system ready for the MVP, had I not come across this great tutorial.

#### My Failed Mint
Initially, I joined the discord with high hopes of minting a Dronie when the project launched. Unfortunately, I had decided I would buy one only a day before launch, so I was too late to try and get myself a pre-launch token by being active in the discord chats, and buying one in the pre-launch. 

No bother, I logged on for what I thought was the launch time to see if I could grab myself a dronie. 


#### On to the Backup Plan
So after the disappointment of not being able to mint a Dronie, I went to the secondary market on Magic Eden 



#### Rarity
The rarity charts were not out yet. So when I bought on the secondary market, I was just buying blind. I had heard one of the founding team mention in passing on the launch livestream that dronies with a mask are slightly rarer. This was the only clue I had going in. Luckily, I found one that I liked the look of, which also had a mask and which was at a price point that I could afford (5 Solana, or around $500). So without dithering too much I made a decision, and I bought it. 

#### HODL?
My initial plan was to mint two dronies, sell one on the secondary market for a quick profit to cover some of my initial costs, and keep one for the long term. This plan went up in flames pretty quickly when I couldn't even mint one dronie. 

I am genuinely quite interested by the roadmap that the Unfold team has laid out for this project. In future, I can look forward to a comic strip that is only available to members, and even further down the line I will be able to attend events where only those who own a Dronie are able to attend. 

#### Down the Rabbit Hole
