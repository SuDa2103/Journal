#### TL;DR
* I did a ton of research and ended up investing in a project called Dronies
* I liked the designs, the team behind the project, the roadmap and the hype they managed to generate around their launch. 
* There were problems at the start which meant I couldn't mint one, so I had to buy one on the secondary market at a slightly higher price. 


#### How I found out
I was watching a Noah kagan video where he interviews NFT experts, and one of them mentioned a project called Dronies. That peaked my interest because there are a dozen NFT projects launching every day, so I wanted to find out more about why he was so excited about this one in particular. 


#### Why I Took the Plunge
The Unfold team, who are behind the Dronies project, are very experienced. I thought the actual artwork looked super slick. It's very hard to predict what becomes cool, but there were some promising signs when it came to Dronies. They were being talked about, every YouTube video I saw about them was positive, and Shaq had even tweeted about the project!

There are dozens of NFT projects launching every day now, so the utility that these NFTs give their owner is very important. Gone are the days where cool pictures can lead to a 100x appreciation. There were things in the Dronies roadmap that I found particularly interesting. 


#### My Failed Mint
Initially, I joined the discord with high hopes of minting a Dronie when the project launched. Unfortunately, I had decided I would buy one only a day before launch, so I was too late to try and get myself a pre-launch token by being active in the discord chats, and buying one in the pre-launch. 

No bother, I logged on for what I thought was the launch time to see if I could grab myself a dronie. But no, I had got the wrong time! It turns out 12 noon UK time was the start of the pre-launch, and the pre-launch would go on for 8 hours!

There were 10,000 dronies to begin with, and watching the number of Dronies available to mint go down over the course of these 8 hours was excruciating. When it got to the public launch time, there were only about 1800 of the original 10,000 left! No bother, I refreshed the page at launch time, and got to work. But unfortunately, there were so many people on the site at the time that the re-captcha just kept freezing. While my captcha form was still loading, I saw the number of remaining dronies tick down until it eventually got to 0. 


#### On to the Backup Plan
Maybe this is a bad mindset to have, but I had spent the whole day looking into and being excited about Dronies. So I was going to get myself a dronie. 

So after the disappointment of not being able to mint a Dronie, I went to the secondary market on Magic Eden. I had trasnferred exactly 7 Solana tokens into my account, so that I could buy some Dronies. I had this much to play around with. I knew I'd have to pay a bit of a premium but I wanted to hold on to this project for the long-term, so I was okay with that. 


#### Rarity
The rarity charts were not out yet. So when I bought on the secondary market, I was just buying blind. I had heard one of the founding team mention in passing on the launch livestream that dronies with a mask are slightly rarer. This was the only clue I had going in. Luckily, I found one that I liked the look of, which also had a mask and which was at a price point that I could afford (5 Solana, or around $500). So without dithering too much I made a decision, and I bought it. 

#### HODL?
My initial plan was to mint two dronies, sell one on the secondary market for a quick profit to cover some of my initial costs, and keep one for the long term. This plan went up in flames pretty quickly when I couldn't even mint one dronie. 

As I said, I am genuinely quite interested by the roadmap that the Unfold team has laid out for this project. In future, I can look forward to a comic strip that is only available to members, and even further down the line I will be able to attend events where only those who own a Dronie are able to attend. 

#### Down the Rabbit Hole
