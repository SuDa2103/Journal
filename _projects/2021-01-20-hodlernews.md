## HackerNews?

For those that don't know, HackerNews is basically a forum for nerds. People working in the tech industry, and people who just love technology visit the site and post links to interesting articles every day. Because of this, you can often find out about major technology trends on Hacker News years before these trends appear on mainstream media. 


## HackerNews for Crypto?
I built HODLerNews to build the same kind of community for Crypto. There is no central place where people interested in Crypto, Web3 and DeFi go to discuss. There are tonnes of crypto related forums out there, but they are full of spammers and people trying to promote their own coin. My aim is to build a space where people can have serious discussions about the long-term trends around crypto, rather than just discussing the daily price moves.
