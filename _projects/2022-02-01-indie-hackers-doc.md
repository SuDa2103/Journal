This is a simple google sheet outlining in detail the career timelines of some of Silicon Valley's heavy hitters and some of the most famous Indie Hackers, to give you guidance and inspiration. Most of all, you can get a sense of the huge variation when it comes to career timelines and when these people started the business that eventually led to them becoming well-known. 

The document is divided into one section for founders of the big, VC-funded unicorns we all know about, and another section for famous Indie Hackers, who have managed to build large, successful businesses while bootstrapping.
